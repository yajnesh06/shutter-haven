```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Adding New Images

### Image Storage Options

1. **Cloud Storage (Recommended)**:
   - Use services like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Cloudinary
   - Benefits:
     - Better performance
     - Automatic image optimization
     - CDN delivery
     - Multiple image sizes/formats

2. **Project Assets**:
   - Store images in `public/images/`
   - Use relative paths in the images array

### Adding New Images

1. Upload your image to your chosen storage solution
2. Add the image information to the `images` array in `src/pages/Index.tsx`:

```typescript
{
  id: 'unique-id',
  url: 'your-image-url',
  width: original-width,
  height: original-height,
  title: 'Image Title',
  category: 'people' | 'animals' | 'landscapes'
}
```

## Image Optimization Tips

- Use compressed images (JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics)
- Implement responsive images using srcset
- Consider using a CDN
- Use appropriate image dimensions (avoid oversized images)
- Enable lazy loading for better performance

## Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing TypeScript types and interfaces
- Maintain the component structure
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implement responsive design patterns
- Test across different devices and screen sizes

## Performance Optimizations

- Lazy loading of images
- Image compression and optimization
- Code splitting
- Route-based chunking
- Caching strategies
- Service Worker implementation

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- iOS Safari
- Chrome for Android

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Deployment

The application can be built for production using:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory, ready for deployment to your chosen hosting platform.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Images not loading**: Check your image paths and ensure proper permissions
2. **Build failures**: Verify all dependencies are installed and Node.js version is compatible
3. **Layout issues**: Check Tailwind CSS classes and responsive design implementations
