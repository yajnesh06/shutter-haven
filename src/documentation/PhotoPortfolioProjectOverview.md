## Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The application follows a component-based architecture using React and TypeScript. The structure emphasizes:

- **Separation of concerns**: UI components, data fetching logic, and utilities are clearly separated
- **Reusable components**: Core UI elements designed for reusability across the application
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach ensuring optimal display across all device sizes
- **Route-based organization**: Content filtered through URL routes for better user navigation

## Technology Stack

### Frontend Technologies

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| React 18 | Component-based UI library |
| TypeScript | Static typing for improved developer experience |
| React Router DOM | Navigation and routing |
| Framer Motion | Animations and transitions |
| Tailwind CSS | Utility-first styling |
| Shadcn UI | UI component library |
| Tanstack Query | Data fetching, caching, synchronization |

### Backend Technologies

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Supabase | Backend-as-a-Service platform |
| Supabase Storage | Image file storage |
| Supabase Database | Image metadata storage |
| Supabase Authentication | User authentication (if implemented) |
| Supabase Realtime | Real-time updates (if implemented) |

## Key Features Implementation

### Masonry Grid Layout

The application implements a responsive masonry grid layout that:

- Dynamically calculates and maintains proper image aspect ratios
- Adapts to different screen sizes with appropriate column counts
- Implements staggered animations for smooth loading experiences
- Uses CSS column-based layout for optimal performance

**Key implementation details:**
- CSS columns for layout structure
- Dynamic padding calculation based on aspect ratio
- Framer Motion for entrance animations
- Intersection Observer API for visibility detection

### Progressive Image Loading

The application implements a three-stage progressive loading strategy:

1. **Placeholder/Blur**: Initial low-quality placeholder or blur hash
2. **Thumbnail**: Low-resolution preview (100px width)
3. **Medium Resolution**: Mid-sized image (800px width)
4. **Full Resolution**: Complete high-quality image

This approach significantly improves perceived performance by showing content quickly while gradually enhancing quality.

### Category-Based Filtering

Image filtering is implemented through:

- URL-based routing (`/people`, `/animals`, `/landscapes`)
- React Query for data fetching with category parameters
- Prefetching adjacent categories for seamless navigation
- Clean separation between UI state and data fetching logic

### Interactive Image Preview

The full-screen image preview implements:

- Modal-based overlay with backdrop blur
- Animated transitions using Framer Motion
- Responsive controls adapting to device size
- Touch-friendly interaction patterns for mobile users
- Keyboard navigation support

## Component Structure

├── Layout
│   ├── Navigation
│   └── Main Content Area
├── Pages
│   ├── Index (Gallery View)

```

### Key Component Responsibilities

| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| Layout | Page structure, navigation, responsiveness |
| MasonryGrid | Image grid layout, loading strategies |
| ImageCard | Individual image display, hover effects |
| ImagePreview | Full-screen image viewing experience |

## State Management

### React Query Implementation

The application uses Tanstack Query (React Query) for data fetching and state management, providing:

- Automatic caching of image data
- Background refetching for data freshness
- Loading and error states
- Prefetching of related categories

**Example Query Implementation:**
```typescript
const { images, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['images', category],
  queryFn: () => getImages(category),
  staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
});
```

### Custom Hooks

Custom hooks encapsulate business logic:

- `useImages`: Handles image fetching, caching, prefetching
- Additional custom hooks as needed for specific features

## Performance Optimizations

The application implements several performance optimization strategies:

1. **Lazy Loading**
   - Images load only when they enter viewport
   - Implementation using Intersection Observer API

2. **Progressive Image Loading**
   - Multi-stage loading approach
   - Blur placeholders during loading

3. **Data Caching**
   - React Query's intelligent caching
   - Optimized invalidation strategies
   - Prefetching adjacent categories

4. **Rendering Optimizations**
   - CSS containment for layout isolation
   - GPU-accelerated animations with `will-change`
   - Deferred rendering of off-screen content

5. **Bundle Optimization**
   - Code splitting by route
   - Tree-shaking unused code
   - Asset optimization

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Public API key for Supabase

### Build Process

The application uses Vite for fast development and optimized production builds:
- Development server with hot module replacement
- Production builds with code splitting and minification
- TypeScript compilation and validation

### Hosting Recommendations

The application can be deployed to various platforms:
- Vercel for serverless deployment
- Netlify for continuous deployment
- Firebase Hosting for Google Cloud integration
- AWS Amplify for AWS ecosystem

### Performance Monitoring

Recommendations for production monitoring:
- Web Vitals tracking for core metrics
- Error tracking with services like Sentry
- Analytics for user behavior insights
